Thus, they can take d values (with d the dimension of the local Hilbert space).","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/","page":"Theoretical Background","title":"Theoretical Background","text":"Any state in the Hilbert space of a one-dimensional many-body system can in principle be represented by a MPS by choosing a sufficiently large value for the bond dimension D [Orus]. On top of this intellectually satisfying property of MPSs being a dense set of states for a 1d-system, they can also be used as a practical Ansätze for a many-body quantum states by setting a maximal allowed value chi for the bond dimension D. In doing so, we restrict ourselves to a corner of the total Hilbert space. The rationale behind this Ansatz is the following: if the initial quantum state of a many-body system has a low bond dimension (typically if the initial state is a product state with D = 1), then in a finite time it will only be able to explore a region of the Hilbert space that is not to far away from its starting point. Thus, the bond dimension will not have the time to diverge exponentially [poulin_quantum_2011]. However, depending on the physical system at hand, this sub-manifold of the Hilbert space could still be \"too large\". There is an additional reason that explains why MPSs are good Ansätze for 1d physical systems. Most many-body Hamiltonians we (physicists) are interested in are local, meaning that the interactions they describe involve objects that are \"neighbours\". For such Hamiltonians, the ground states (outside of potential critical phases) follow the so called area law for the entanglement entropy [srednicki_entropy_1993][vidal_entanglement_2003][wolf_area_2008]. This law states that the entanglement entropy S_vN of a bi-partition of the system is proportional, not to the volume of the partition as one might expect, but to the hyper-surface of the partition's boundary; hence the name \"area law\". For a 3d system this corresponds to an actual surface area A, S_vN sim A; for a 2d system it corresponds to the length L of the partition's boundary, S_vN sim L; and in 1d the boundary reduces to a point, thus the entropy will be independent of the size of the system S_vN sim textconstant. The MPSs are states that satisfy this area law.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/","page":"Theoretical Background","title":"Theoretical Background","text":"An application of the Singular Value Decomposition is to create efficient approximations of quantum states to perform computations. The main idea is to reduce the content of the MPS to keep only the parts that contain the physics of interest. One method to realise this approximation is to do a SVD on each of the tensors of the MPS after each time step of the state time-evolution and to trim the smallest singular values in order to decrease the bond dimension of the MPS down to a chosen maximal value chi. The corresponding columns and rows of the unitary matrices U and V^dagger are also removed. Then, the trimmed matrices tildeU, tildeS and tildeV^dagger are contracted back to give an approximated tensor T with a smaller bond dimension. Another way to apply the restricted rank approximation is to restrict oneself into working in a manifold of fixed bond dimension D and to use methods that can enforce this constraint.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/#MPO","page":"Theoretical Background","title":"MPO","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/","page":"Theoretical Background","title":"Theoretical Background","text":"In order to compute expectation values of observables or apply unitary transformations to a quantum state, we need a TN representation of operators.

The generalisation to trees introduces no new conceptual complexity (only implementational complexity). The sites of a TTN are usually referred to as nodes.  For our purposes, every node of a TTN state and operator has one parent leg, and any number (including zero) of child legs.

Two chains are defined: the chain labelled 1 for the empty modes, the chain labelled 2 for the filled modes. The following relations are used to define the functions equivalent to the spectral density of the bosonic case, one for each chain: $ \\begin{split}    &V{1k} = V{k} \\sin \\thetak = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilonk}+1}} \\\n   &V{2k} = V{k} \\cos \\thetak = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{e^{-\\beta \\epsilonk}+1}},  \\end{split} $     where we choose the spectral function that characterizes the fermionic bath to be: V_k= sqrt1-k^2, and we define the dispersion relation as: e_k = k, that is, a linear dispersion relation with propagation speed equal to 1. This latter choice corresponds to a model of metals (gapless energy spectrum). We select a filled state as the initial state of the defect. Using the mapping proposed in [khon_efficient_2021], the chain Hamiltonian becomes: $     \\begin{split}     \\hat H^\\text{chain}  = \\hat H\\text{loc} &+ \\sum{i = {1,2}}\\bigg[ J{i,0} \\Big(\\hat d^\\dagger \\hat a{i,0} + \\hat d \\hat a{i,0}^\\dagger \\Big) + \\ &+ \\sum{n=1}^\\infty  \\Big( J{i,n} \\hat a{i,n}^\\dagger \\hat a{i,n-1} +  J{i,n} \\hat  a{i,n-1}^\\dagger \\hat a{i,n} \\Big) + \\sum{n=0}^\\infty E{i,n} \\hat  a{i,n}^\\dagger \\hat a{i,n} \\bigg],     \\end{split} $ where the J_in coefficients are the couplings between the chain sites and the E_in coefficients are the energies associated to each chain site. Clearly, the interactions are between nearest neighbors. This, combined with the fact that the fermions in our model are spinless, enables a straightforward mapping into fermionic operators of the bosonic creation and annihilation operators, that on their part obey to the bosonic commutation relations: hat b_i hat b_j^dagger = delta_ij, hat b_i hat b_j =hat b_i^dagger hat b_j^dagger =0 forall ij. The mapping derived from Jordan-Wigner transformations for spinless fermions is: $     \\hat a{i}^\\dagger \\hat a{i+1} + \\hat a{i+1}^\\dagger \\hat a{i} = \\hat b{i}^\\dagger \\hat b{i+1} + \\hat b{i+1}^\\dagger \\hat b{i}.   $","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/anderson-model/#Double-chain-mapping","page":"The Anderson Impurity Model","title":"Double chain mapping","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/anderson-model/","page":"The Anderson Impurity Model","title":"The Anderson Impurity Model","text":"The corresponding MPO representation is: $ \\begin{split} & \\begin{bmatrix}  \\hat{\\mathbb I} & J{2,N} \\hat b{2,N}^\\dagger & J{2,N} \\hat b{2,N} & E{2,N} \\hat b{2,N}^\\dagger \\hat b{2,N}  \\end{bmatrix}\\cdot ... \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}  \\hat{ \\mathbb I} & J{2,0} \\hat b{2,0}^\\dagger & J{2,0} \\hat b{2,0} & E{2,0} \\hat b{2,0}^\\dagger \\hat b{2,0}\\\n0 &0 & 0 & \\hat b{2,0} \\\n0 &0 & 0 & \\hat b{2,0}^\\dagger \\\n0 &0 & 0 & \\hat{\\mathbb I} \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\ \\cdot & \\begin{bmatrix}  \\hat{ \\mathbb I} & \\hat d^\\dagger & \\hat d & \\epsilond \\hat d^\\dagger \\hat d\\\n0 &0 & 0 & \\hat d \\\n0 &0 & 0 & \\hat d^\\dagger \\\n0 &0 & 0 & \\hat{\\mathbb I} \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot  \\begin{bmatrix}  \\hat{ \\mathbb I} & \\hat b{1,0}^\\dagger & \\hat b{1,0} & E{1,0} \\hat b{1,0}^\\dagger \\hat b{1,0}\\\n0 &0 & 0 & \\hat J{1,0}b{1,0} \\\n0 &0 & 0 & \\hat J{1,0}b{1,0}^\\dagger \\\n0 &0 & 0 & \\hat{\\mathbb I} \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot  ... \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}  E{2,N} \\hat b{2,N}^\\dagger \\hat b{2,N} \\ J{2,N} \\hat b{2,N} \\ J{2,N} \\hat b_{2,N}^\\dagger \\ \\hat{\\mathbb I} \\end{bmatrix} \\end{split} $","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/anderson-model/","page":"The Anderson Impurity Model","title":"The Anderson Impurity Model","text":"The system starts from a filled state, the chain starts as in the Fermi sea.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/anderson-model/#Interleaved-chain-mapping","page":"The Anderson Impurity Model","title":"Interleaved chain mapping","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/anderson-model/","page":"The Anderson Impurity Model","title":"The Anderson Impurity Model","text":"The drawback of such a representation though, is that the particle-hole pairs are spatially separated in the MPS, creating correlations and therefore leading to a dramatic increase in the bond dimensions. This is why Kohn and Santoro propose an interleaved geometry, the advantages of which are thoroughly explained in \\cite{KohnSantoro2021b}. Exploiting the interleaved representation, the interaction comes to be between next-nearest neighbors: a string operator appears in the Jordan-Wigner transformation from bosons to fermions: $     \\hat a{i}^\\dagger \\hat a{i+2} + \\hat a{i+2}^\\dagger \\hat a{i} = \\hat b{i}^\\dagger \\hat F{i+1} \\hat b{i+2} + \\hat b{i} \\hat F{i+1} \\hat b{i+2}^\\dagger, $ where the string operator hat F_i is defined as: \\hat Fi = (-1)^{\\hat ni} = \\hat{\\mathbb I} -2 \\hat ni = \\hat{\\mathbb I}-2 \\hat bi^\\dagger \\hat bi.

The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics at finite temperature using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping.
